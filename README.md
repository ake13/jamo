### Just Another Music Organizer

Built for lazy people like me that love music and have a lot of locally stored tracks without a naming convention and/or tags.
Created because it's a pain to go through the nightmare of track identification, sorting into a genre folder, tagging, etc.
In other words, lots of time spent sorting, that could be better spent listening!
This tiny script uses shazam APIs to identify the songs, taking audio files as input and renames them while organizing them into genre sub-folders.
